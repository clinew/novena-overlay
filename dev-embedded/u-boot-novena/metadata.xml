		The U-Boot bootloader, with light patches for Novena's DDR3 memory etc.

		This version creates a first stage bootloader (u-boot.spl) and a main,
		second-stage bootloader (u-boot.img), and installs these into
		/usr/share/u-boot-novena/.

		Matching the original Debian package semantics, when built this package
		will also copy u-boot.{spl,img} to /boot (which must be mounted) and then
		install the first stage bootloader (u-boot.spl) into the MBR of the
		Novena's on-board micro-SD card.

		In case you need to install u-boot.spl to the MBR of an SD-card
		yourself, a utility program (novena-install-spl) is also provided.
