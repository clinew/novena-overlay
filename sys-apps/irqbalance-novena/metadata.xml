		Linux systems normally send all interrupts (IRQs) to one CPU, unless they
		are explicitly farmed out to other CPUs. This package, irqbalance-novena,
		takes care of distributing the interrupt load among all available processors
		on the Novena single board computer.

		It is a fork of v0.56, because newer versions rely on x86-specific bits
		that are not present on ARM.

		Running irqbalance will improve performance. Notably, audio stutters much
		less when running irqbalance.
