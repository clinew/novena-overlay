		All USB Bluetooth >= v2.1 dongles support a feature called secure simple
		pairing, or "SSP".

		Unfortunately this can cause problems with Bluetooth keyboards, which
		often fail to reassociate.

		This package provides a small daemon which will monitor all Bluetooth
		adaptors and disable SSP on them when it sees them.

		Please note that this version is only packaged for OpenRC, not (yet) systemd.
